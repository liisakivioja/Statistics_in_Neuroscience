**1.** The experiment examined the effect of physical exercise on mental health. The subject’s (N=30) anxiety scores were collected with the Spielberger anxiety scales after an 8-month period. The subjects either participated in a physical training program for 8 months (N=15) or they did not (N=15). This research examines whether the gathered data follows normal distribution by performing the normality tests by obtaining the skewness and kurtosis values and performing the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. The null hypothesis states that the gathered data of the subject’s anxiety values does follow normal distribution. The alternative hypothesis states that the gathered data of the subject’s anxiety values does not follow normal distribution. 
For the anxiety variable, we see that the mean and the standard deviation of the scores is higher in the training condition (mean = 34.87, sd = 7.52) than in the no training condition (mean = 32.47, sd = 4.27). Our results show that the training condition shows skewness of 0.09 (SE = 0.58) and kurtosis of -1.37 (SE = 1.12), while the no training condition shows skewness of 0.72 (SE = 0.58) and kurtosis of -0.18 (SE = 1.12). According to our calculated z scores (training condition: skewness = 0.1596258, kurtosis = - 1.22024; no training condition: skewness = 1.238597, kurtosis = - 0.1571744), the skewness and kurtosis values are non-significant as all values fall in the range of -1.96 to 1.96. Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis. To test the normality of the distribution of either group, we used the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, where we tested against a criterion level alpha of 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test results came back as non-significant for both the training condition (W = 0.949, p = 0.513) and the no training condition (W = 0.9243, p-value = 0.224). Only the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality in this case, since it performs better for small sample sizes than the One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Together with the non-skewed distribution in the histograms, we conclude that we do not reject the null hypothesis.

**2.** The distribution of the sum scores would be normally distributed since it is a large random sample taken from a regular population. 
For the sample taken from a clinical population, the distribution of the sample would not be normally distributed as the sample is not taken from a regular population, but from a population with a behaviour disorder. As more extreme behaviour is evaluated with a higher score, upon summing the scores from this population, a negatively skewed graph would be obtained. The negative skew can therefore be explained by the tail of the distribution being on the left side.

**3.** The research question whether there is a relationship between the frequency of the disease happening and the specific genotype (BB/Bb/bb) of subjects in both case and control groups, can be answered by doing the Pearson's Chi-squared test. All assumptions were met before performing this test.  
Our results showed: X-squared = 5.4324, df = 2, p-value = 0.06613. 
The Chi-squared test therefore shows a non-significant value (p > 0.05), meaning the two variables are not related. Looking at the generated histograms gave an additional overview suggesting that the disease frequency is not genotype dependent.
