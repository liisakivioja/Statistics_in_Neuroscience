**1** In this experimental study, the relation between learning disabilities (either in reading (RD), in arithmetic (AD), or both (RAD)) with the experimental task of making trail of numbers, of the subjects were measured. The task performance was measured in RD (N= 24, mean = 23.79, SD = 8.21), AD (N= 20, mean = 25.8, SD = 8.11), RAD (N=21, mean = 26.29, SD = 8.92) and CA (N= 24, mean = 24.00, SD = 8.73) groups. We are interested in finding out whether the 4 groups differ with respect to the variable trailnum. The null hypothesis for this would state that regardless of the group the subjects are grouped into, they perform the same way in the trail number task. The alternative hypothesis would state that the group determines how the subject will perform on the trail number task. For this, we tested normality and homogeneity of variance, and later conducted pairwise post hoc tests which were corrected (Bonferroni). For these analyses an alpha value of 0.05 was used.   
To test normality, we generated histograms and used a formal Shapiro normality test. For control group (W = 0.9474, p-value = 0.2378) and group AD (W = 0.96755, p-value = 0.7266), the test came back non-significant. For group RAD (W = 0.92838, p-value = 0.1617) and group RD (W = 0.92587, p-value = 0.08906) the test came back significant, as we tested against the alpha of 0.05. Together with the histogram we can conclude that the trailnum variable is not normally distributed in the groups for RAD and RD, meaning normality assumption is violated. 
Because of this, we got rid of the outliers from the datasets (this changes the sample size reported above) and tested again for normality. This time the test came back non-significant for groups RAD (W = 0.92838, p-value = 0.1617) and RD (W = 0.92587, p-value = 0.08906), meaning the normality assumption was no longer violated.

The variances could not be considered homogenous after performing the Levene’s test: F(3,81) = 3.3709, p = 0.02242, as the variances are statistically significantly different across the 4 groups. 
Next, we will run Welch’s test since we have normally distributed data that violates the assumption of homogeneity of variance. The Welch’s test reports the F-statistic: F(3.00,44.28) = 0.31833, p = 0.812 indicating non-significance. Therefore, the test suggests that the groups do not differ significantly with respect to their trail number test scores. Because the Welch’s test came back non-significant, we do not need to conduct a post hoc test.

The figures and the conducted Welch’s test therefore suggest that the 4 investigated groups do not differ significantly from their performance when performing the trail number task.

**2** In this experimental study, the relation between learning disabilities (either in reading (RD), in arithmetic (AD), or both (RAD)) with the experimental task of making trail of numbers and letters, of the subjects were measured. The task performance was measured in RD (N= 24, mean = 42.12, SD = 12.27), AD (N= 21, mean = 53.62, SD = 14.75, RAD (N=21, mean = 53.90, SD = 14.61) and CA (N= 23, mean = 40.91, SD = 12.66) groups. We are interested in finding out whether the 4 groups differ with respect to the variable trailnumlet. The null hypothesis for this would state that regardless of the group the subjects are grouped into, they perform the same way in the trail number and letter task. The alternative hypothesis would state that the group determines how the subject will perform on the trail number and letter task. For this, we tested normality and homogeneity of variance, and later conducted pairwise post hoc tests which were corrected (Bonferroni). For these analyses an alpha value of 0.05 was used.   
To test normality, we generated histograms and used a formal Shapiro normality test. For control group (W = 0.94851, p-value = 0.2725), group AD (W = 0.97154, p-value = 0.7668), group RAD (W = 0.96123, p-value = 0.5413) and group RD (W = 0.9308, p-value = 0.1016), the test came back non-significant as we tested against the alpha of 0.05. Together with the histogram we can conclude that the trailnum variable is normally distributed in the four groups, meaning normality assumption is not violated.

_**Figure 4.** Histograms for each group separately with a group-specific normal curve._

The variances could be considered homogenous after performing the Levene’s test: F(3,85) = 0.51, p = 0.68, as the variances are not statistically significantly different across the 4 groups. As there are no normality and homogeneity violations, we can perform one-way ANOVA analysis. Looking at the F statistic of the regular ANOVA: F(3,85) = 3336, p = 0.00087 we determine that this is significant. 
To finish off, we performed pairwise post hoc tests on the data as the ANOVA came back significant. Based on the matrix we see that the means of control and RD group, and the means of AD and RAD groups are non-significant, with a p value of 1.0. Based on the pairwise test of RD group against AD (p = 0.034) and RAD (p = 0.028) groups, and control group against AD (p = 0.015) and RAD (p = 0.012) groups, we see that the tests show significance, therefore their means are not the same.

_**Figure 6.** Generated error bar plot from the data derived from subjects belonging to four groups against the variable trailnumlet._

From the figures, the conducted one-way ANOVA and post hoc test suggest that there is a significant performance difference between the 4 investigated groups, in which the subjects differ significantly in their performance when performing the trail number task.

**3** In this experimental study, the relation between a subject’s (N = 40) IQ and their respective genotype was investigated. The people were divided into three groups based on their genotypes: genotype aa (N = 10, mean = 89.6, SD = 16.3), genotype Aa (N = 20, mean = 107.1, SD = 8.41), genotype AA (N = 10, mean = 113.6, SD = 9.92). We are interested in finding out whether the genotype groups with A-allele differ with respect to the IQ variable from aa genotype. The null hypothesis for this would state that the presence of A-allele has no influence on increasing the IQ scores of the subjects. The alternative hypothesis would state that the presence of A-allele is increasing the IQ scores of the subjects. For this, we tested the normality, homogeneity of variance, and later conducted Helmert contrasts in R. For these analyses an alpha value of 0.05 was used.   
To test normality, we generated histograms and used a formal Shapiro normality test. The calculated normality for the aa group (W = 0.95454, p-value = 0.7223), the Aa group (W = 0.92234, p-value = 0.1099) and the AA group (W = 0.94252, p-value = 0.5814) showed non-significance. This indicates that the sample population follows a normal distribution. The variances could be considered homogenous after performing the Levene’s test: F(2,37) = 2.45, p = 0.09977, as the variances are not statistically significantly different across the 3 groups, meaning the sample means do not differ significantly. As both assumptions were met for an ANOVA test, we proceeded with that. The ANOVA for out test was significant (F(2,37) = 12.74, p = 6.19 e-05), indicating that from the genotype groups, at least one differed from others. Lastly, because we are interested in the contrast in which we compare the non-carriers of the A-allele to carriers of the A-allele (aa versus Aa+AA) and Aa versus AA, we conducted the Helmert contrasts. This contrast showed there to be a significant difference in the groups of aa vs Aa + AA, in terms of the subject’s IQ scores (t = 55.52, p = < 2 e-16). Concluding, we suggest that individuals with an A allele within our chosen population can be associated with having a higher IQ.
