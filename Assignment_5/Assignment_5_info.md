**1** Anthropometric measures of height and intracranial volume (ICV) were collected in N=40 individuals (singletons selected from twin pairs), to test the research question of “Can the subject’s relationship between height and brain volume be explained by sex differences in overall body size?”. For this, a simple regression model with only sex as a predictor for ICV was compared to a multiple regression model including both height and sex as predictors. The two-sided null hypothesis of this study would state that the subject’s relationship between height and ICV cannot be explained by sex differences in overall body size, whereas the alternative hypothesis would state that the subject’s sex would indeed determine whether height is a good predictor of measuring their ICV. We tested against an alpha of 0.05. 
In this sample, the mean of ICV was 96.42 cm3 in females (N=17) (sd = 8.35) and 108.92 cm3 in males (N=23) (sd = 8.31); the mean of heights was 1.71 meters in females (N=17) (sd = 0.10) and 1.82 meters in males (N=23) (sd = 0.08).  
For the simple regression model with only sex as a predictor, the F statistic (1,38) = 22.05, came back significant (p = 3.42e-05). The R^2 is 0.37 and the adjusted R^2 is 0.35, with the regression coefficient being b = 12.51 (t(38) = 4.70, p = 3.42e-05). This means that the subject’s sex seems to explain a moderate amount of the variation in subject’s ICV. For the multiple regression model with both sex and height as predictors, the F statistic (2,37) = 10.97, came back significant (p = 1.82e-04). The R^2 is 0.37 and the adjusted R^2 is 0.34, with the regression coefficient of sex being significant (b = 11.61 (t(37) = 3.68, p = 7.39e-04) and the regression coefficient for height being non-significant (b = 8.14 (t(37) = 0.54, p = 0.59). Together, the predictors included explain a slightly less (than the model above), but still a moderate amount of the variation in subject’s ICV. 
Looking at the difference in the adjusted R^2 between the two models, the value was 0.01, meaning that the multiple regression model explained 1% less of the variance in the brain volume than the simple regression model. The F change test assessing the models’ differences also came back non-significant (F (1,37) = 0.29, p = 0.59), meaning that height is not a good predictor for the subject’ ICV once the sex differences have been accounted for. Therefore, the regression model with only sex as a predictor used should be determined a better fit. 

**2** In a sample of 90 children, the digit span forward (M= 5.66, SD= 1.67) and backward tasks (M= 4.42, SD= 1.41) were administered. In addition, general cognitive ability (or IQ) was measured using the rakit test (M= 18.13, SD= 4.05), and age in months was recorded (M= 129.8, SD= 7.34). The digit span forward is considered as simple memory task, while the backward task is considered a working memory task: children need to not only remember but also process the stimuli before being able to formulate a correct answer. We want to know whether backward scores can be predicted using forward scores. However, as memory capacity also depends on general cognitive ability and age, we want to know specifically whether simple memory capacity is still predictive of working memory capacity when differences in cognitive ability and age are accounted for. 
To test this, we first fit a regression model including digitB as outcome variable and rakit and age as predictors. This model did fit significantly better than the means model (F(2,87)=6.69, p=0.00199, R2=0.13, adjusted R2=0.11), with rakit as a non-significant predictor (beta=0.032, p=0.36) and age as a significant predictor (beta=0.069, p=0.00055). 
We then added digitF to the model. This model did fit significantly better than the model without digitF (F(3,86)=10.3, p=7.33e-06, increase in R2=0.26, increase in adjusted R2=0.24), with rakit as a non-significant predictor (beta=0.030, p=0.35), age as a significant predictor (beta=0.048, p=0.012), and digitF as a significant predictor (beta=0.32, p=0.00018). 
With all VIFs < 1.1 and a mean VIF of 1.06, there was not an indication of multicollinearity between the three predictors. The relationship between digitF and digitB was linear and visual inspection did not show evidence of outliers. The Breusch-Pagan test (BP=7.78, p=0.05) and examination of the residuals showed there was not a concern about heteroscedasticity. The Durbin-Watson test (DW=1.81, p=0.36) and examination of the residuals showed there was not a concern about autocorrelation. The distribution of the residuals was normal (W=0.99, p=0.91). 
We therefore conclude that the digit span forward and age are good predictors for the digit span backward scores. 

**3** For the multiple regression model in question 2 (where we ran regression between the intercept and all predictor’s slopes), we used multiple t-tests. Because of this, multiple test correction would be appropriate to apply here. The Bonferroni correction is more conservative, however here the dataset is not too big so it should not make too much of a difference. However, let us test with both Bonferroni and FDR. 
According to the table below, we can see that performing the corrections has corrected the slopes of the predictos age and digitF to become less significant. Overall however, this does not lead to any change in the conclusion we made in the regression model of question 2.
